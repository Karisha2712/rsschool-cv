**About me**

I study in Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics.

I aspire to become a front-end developer. I learn the material quickly. I always try to find the most *optimal* ways to solve the problem.  I share my room with my little sister, so I'm quite *stress-reliant*. I am fond of ui/ux design, I made layouts of sites, I like drawing pictures and writing poems, so I can say that I am a *creative* person. I always do my work with *high quality* and *accuracy*. 

**Skills**

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Git&Github
- Figma

**Experience**

I have no experience working as a developer in a company. However, studying at the university taught me how to work in a team, introduced me to the concept of a deadline and gave me a little experience in front-end development.

**English level**

At the moment my level of English is **pre-intermediate**, however I am in the process of learning it. Learning English now has the highest priority for me, because this skill is extremely important for communicating with customers and partners.
